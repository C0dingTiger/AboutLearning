""  vs ''
	'': A single-quoted string does not have variables within it interpreted
	"": when you use double quotes PHP has to parse to check if there are any variables within the string. 

To split string:
	substr():
		substr(string,start,length):
			echo substr("hellowworld", 0, 5)."\n";     =======> hello
	 	
		substr(string,start,indexFromTheEnd):   the last character is -1
			echo substr("hellowworl", 0, -1)."\n";      =======> helloworl

		the way to get substring by startIndex and endIndex:
			The length is the end minus the start.
			$sub = substr("HelloWorld", 5, 10 - 5);     ============>World


	strtr(string,changeFrom,changeTo):
		strtr("Hilla Warld","ia","eo");         ==========> Hello World
		

	explode(separator,string,limit[optional]): The explode() function breaks a string into an array. 
		eg:
			$str = "Hello world. It's a beautiful day.";
			print_r (explode(" ",$str));
			============>  Array ( [0] => Hello [1] => world. [2] => It's [3] => a [4] => beautiful [5] => day. )

Issue: "502 Gate:"
make sure install specific php version which is matching php-fmp version    
and php-fmp.sock is generated by start php-fmp service.  
the path of php-fpm.sock file is setted in $ /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf   ==> listen = path

then set up the nginx port config file : $ /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
